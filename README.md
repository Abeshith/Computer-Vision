## COMPUTER VISION USING OPENCV
## Face, Eye, and Smile Detection

### Purpose
This Python script detects faces, eyes, and smiles in images using OpenCV.

### Usage
- Ensure Python 3.x and OpenCV are installed.
- Download Haar cascade XML files for face, eye, and smile detection.
- Update file paths in the code.
- Run the script and provide the image path.

### Functionality
- Detects faces using a face cascade classifier.
- Draws rectangles around detected faces.
- Detects eyes and smiles within each face ROI.
- Draws rectangles around detected eyes and smiles.
- Displays processed image with detections.
- Press any key to view each detection.
- Press any key to close displayed images.

### Example Output
![Example]('output images/detect-fromPhotos')

### Notes
- Adjust parameters for better detection.
- Requires accurate placement of Haar cascade XML files.
- Basic demonstration, may need refinement for specific needs.
